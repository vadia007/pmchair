<p>The 'Attachments' extension for Joomla! allows files to be uploaded and
attached to articles, categories, or other types of content. The 'Attachments'
extension includes a plugin to display the attachments and a component for
uploading and managing attachments, as well as other plugins. There are
options to control who can see the attachments and who can upload them, along
with several many options to increase its flexibility and usefulness. Note:
all options are controlled through the component manager.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This version of the <em>Attachments</em> extension only works for
Joomla! 1.7, 2.5 or greater.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In the rest of this document, the term <strong>content item</strong> is sometimes
used.  Normally we think of attaching files to articles.  Attachments supports
attaching files and URLs to articles or categories by default.  But it is
possible to attach to other types of content types (this requires special
'Attachments' plugins).  All of these are referred to as <strong>content items</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The 'Attachments' extension has been translated into many different
languages.  Please see the <a class="reference internal" href="#translations">Translations</a> section for the list of
available translations.  Most of these languages packs are in the process
of being updated for 'Attachments' version 3.0.</p>

attachments.  See the <a class="reference internal" href="#attachments-permissions">Attachments Permissions</a> section for more details.</li>
<li>Full support for viewing access levels.  This means you can set some of your
attachments to be visible by anyone, and some to be visible only to users
in certain groups (as defined by the Access Levels).

<p>Not all types of attachment files can be uploaded.  The 'Attachments'
extension will not allow uploading of files that are not permitted by the
Joomla! Media Manager.  To see (or change) what file types are allowed, go to
the <strong>Media manager</strong> item under the <strong>Content</strong> menu.  Click on the
<strong>Options</strong> button on the toolbar and select the <em>Component</em> tab.  There you
will see the options for controlling what types of file extensions and mime
types are permitted for uploads. The 'Attachments' extension respects these
limitations.  However, the restriction on 'Legal Extensions (File
Types)' is ignored.  Add extensions for any file type that you require in the
&quot;Legal Extensions (File Types)&quot; field.  You may also add appropriate MIME
types in the &quot;Legal MIME Types&quot; field.</p>

on the &quot;Options&quot; button on the right end of the tool bar and you will see
options grouped under several tabs.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-options">
<h2>Basic Options</h2>
<img alt="Basic Options" class="float-right" src="images/options-basic.png" />
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Attachments published by default:</strong> This 'auto publish' feature controls
whether new attachments are published by default when they are added. If
'Yes' is selected, when attachments are added, they will published
immediately and will be visible to users. If 'No' is selected, new
attachments will not be published by default.  An administrator or someone
with appropriate permissions will need to publish them from the
administrative back end before the attachments will be available.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Auto Publish Warning:</strong> If the auto-publish option is
disabled (see previous option), you may wish to inform those adding
attachments how they can get their attachment published. You can insert an
appropriate message here.  If this field is empty, a general system message
will be added suggesting that they contact their system administrator to
any newly uploaded attachments published.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Default Access Level:</strong> The default access level for new attachments.
Each attachment has an 'access level' which controls who can see or
download that attachment.  When an attachment is created, its access level
is set to this default value initially (if the attachment creator is in
appropriate groups).  A site administrator or someone with appropriate
permissions may change the attachment's access level to control who can
see that specific attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Name for user-defined field 1-3:</strong> If you have some
additional information about each attachment that you wish to add, the
'Attachments' extension allows you to defined up to three optional user-defined
fields.  To create a new field, insert the name for it in one of the three
entries.  Clear the name to disable the display and editing of this field.
The user-defined fields will be shown in the order listed here.  The maximum
length of each user-defined field name is 40 characters.  The data in these
fields may be up to 100 characters long.</p>
<div class="hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">If you add an asterisk to the end of a user-defined field name, it
will not be displayed on the front end.  It will be visible when an
attachment is edited on the front end and always visible in the back
end.  This hidden user-defined field can be used to order attachments in
an arbitrary order by putting integer values in the field.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Maximum filename or URL length:</strong>
The maximum filename or URL length for attachments list.  Filenames or URLs
longer than this will be truncated and put into the display name (for
display purposes only, the actual filename or URL will not be changed).  A
value of 0 means the filename length is unlimited by this option (the
display_name field in the attachments database table is limited to 80
characters).  Note: If display filenames or URLs are truncated by this option,
the truncated name will be inserted into the &quot;Display Filename / URL&quot; field.
This option only affects attachments added after this option is set.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Where should attachments be placed?</strong> This option controls
the location in the article (or content item) the list of attachments will be placed.
This option applies to all attachments lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">'<em>At the beginning</em>'</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'<em>At the end</em>'</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'<em>Custom placement</em>' - With this option, the attachments list will
appear in the article (or content item) where ever the special tag:
{attachments} occurs.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">In custom placement mode, any article (or content item)
that does not include this tag will display its the attachments list
at its end.</p>
</div>
<p>In this mode, when editing an article in the back
end, an extra button will be displayed: [Insert {attachments} token].
Position the cursor where you want the custom placement token and use
this button to insert the token.  This button will add surrounding HTML
tags to hide the token when it is not replaced (for example when the
attachments list is not supposed to be visible).  In HTML, the token
looks like this with the surrounding tags to hide it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;span class=&quot;hide&quot;&gt;{attachments}&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
<p>In the back end editors, you will see the {attachments} tag but not the
HTML 'span' tags unless you switch to HTML mode.  In the front end, you
will never see the {attachments} tag unless the insert_attachments_tag
plugin is disabled.  If you wish to remove the {attachments} token, you
may want to use the &quot;HTML&quot; view mode in the editor to make sure that
you also delete the surrounding span tags.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The custom placement mode does not work for attachments on
Category descriptions.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'<em>Disabled (filter)</em>' - This option will disable the display of
attachments lists and suppress the display of any {attachments}
tags in articles or content items.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'<em>Disabled (no filter)</em>' - This option will disable the display of
attachments lists and will not suppress the display of any
{attachments} tags in articles (or content items).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Allow frontend editing of the access level:</strong>
Allow setting the access level for an attachment from the front end when
editing an attachment or creating a new attachment.  The 'access level'
controls which groups may view (or access) the attachment. Note that the no
one editing an attachment will ever be able to set the access level for it
to a level for which they are not authorized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formatting-options">
<h2>Formatting Options</h2>
<img alt="Formatting Options" class="float-right" src="images/options-formatting.png" />
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show titles:</strong> If set to 'Yes', a row of titles will be
added above the list of attachments describing what is in each column.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show attachment description:</strong> This setting controls
whether the attachment description is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show attachment creator:</strong> Show the username of the
one who created (uploaded) the attachment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show file size:</strong> This setting controls
whether the attachment file size is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show number of downloads:</strong> This setting controls
whether the number of downloads is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This option only works for file attachments in secure mode!
In non-secure mode, files are maintained as static files and accessed
directly, without going through Joomla! code.  Therefore it is impossible
to update the number of downloads for a file when it is accessed this way.
So the display of the number of file downloads will only work in secure mode
when this option is set to 'Yes'.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show file modification date:</strong> If this setting
is 'Yes', the modification date for the file will be added to the
attachment list for articles that have attachments. If 'No' is
selected, no date will be added to the attachment list.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Format string for modification date:</strong> You may
select the format for the modification date by using the format
used by the PHP strftime() function.  Search the web with
'PHP strftime' for examples.  The default format (%x %H:%M)
gives dates with 24-hour time like 4/28/2008 14:21.  To
remove the time of day part, leave out the &quot;%H:%M&quot; part.  Note
that MS Windows and Linux PHP implementations may differ in
some of the codes that they support.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Attachments list order:</strong> This option allows you to specify the order in
which attachments will be listed in the attachments lists.  Most of the
options are self-explanatory:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>'<em>Filename</em>' - If this option is selected, the attachments will be
sorted alphabetically by the filename.</li>
<li>'<em>File size(smallest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>File size(largest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Description</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Display filename or URL</em>' - All attachments that have blank
display filenames will appear before the ones with display filenames and
will be sorted by their filenames.</li>
<li>'<em>Creator</em>' - Sort by the name of the user who uploaded the attachment.</li>
<li>'<em>Creation date (oldest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Creation date (newest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Modification date (oldest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Modification date (newest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Attachment ID</em>' - If this option is selected, the
attachments will be sorted by the attachment ID.  This has the effect of
ordering the attachments in the order they were created.</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 1</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 2</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 3</em>'</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visibility-options">
<h2>Visibility Options</h2>
<p>These options control when attachments will be visible on the front page,
assuming the user is in the appropriate groups to see the attachments.</p>
<img alt="Visibility Options" class="float-right" src="images/options-visibility.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Hide attachments on the front page:</strong> Select this option to prevent any
attachments from being shown on the front page of your website.</li>
<li><strong>Hide attachments before 'Read More' breaks:</strong> Select this option to
prevent attachments from being displayed on the the front end if they are
before 'Read More' breaks in articles.  If you click on the link to read the
full article, the attachments will be shown.</li>
<li><strong>Hide attachments on blog pages:</strong> Select this option to prevent
attachments from being shown on any page with 'blog' layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Hide attachments except on article views:</strong> Select this option to prevent
attachments from being shown on any page on the front page except for
views for single specific articles.</li>
<li><strong>Always show attachments on category views:</strong> Select this option to always
show attachments on category views -- regardless of other options.</li>
<li><strong>Hide attachments for categories:</strong> Hide attachments on any category views
for the selected categories.  Note that attachments will be displayed for
children categories unless they are explicitly selected.</li>
</ul>
<div class="small-figure figure">
<img alt="Hide Categories Selection" src="images/options-hide-categories.png" />
<p class="caption">To select or deselect categories without affecting other categories, hold
the Control-key when mouse-clicking on the category.  In the figure, only
one category is selected.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Hide 'Add Attachments' link:</strong> Always hide the 'Add Attachments' link on
the front page.  This requires attachments to be added to articles, etc,
by editing them in the front page (where an 'Add Attachments' button will
be available under the editing area).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-options">
<h2>Advanced Options</h2>
<img alt="Advanced Options" class="float-right" src="images/options-advanced.png" />
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Characters forbidden in uploaded filenames:</strong> Filenames containing these
characters will not be allowed to be uploaded.  These characters are
problematic in the URL presented to the user for file attachments in
'non-secure' mode so they are forbidden.  These characters are generally not
an issue when using 'secure' mode since the filename is not used as part of
the URL presented to the user.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CSS style for attachments tables:</strong> To override the CSS
styling of attachments lists, specify your own style name here.  The default
style name is 'attachmentsList'.  See  the section <a class="reference internal" href="#css-styling-of-attachment-lists">CSS Styling of Attachment Lists</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>File link open mode:</strong>
This mode how the links to attachment files will be opened.  'In same window'
means the file will be opened in the same browser window.  'In new window'
means the file will be opened in a new window.  In some browsers, using the
'In new window' option will actually open the attachment in a new tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Custom titles for attachments lists:</strong> By default, the 'Attachments'
extension inserts the title &quot;Attachments:&quot; above the list of attachments for
each article or content item (if it has attachments). In some cases, you may
prefer using some other term for specific articles or content items.  You may
specify the exact term you would like to use on an item-by-item basis. For
example, if you would like article 211 to use the custom title &quot;Downloads:&quot;,
then add this to this setting: '211 Downloads' (without the quotes). Use one
entry per line.  For other types of content items, use the form:
'category:23 This is the title for category 23' where 'category' can be
replaced by the name of the content item entity.  The example for articles
above could have been done with 'article:211 Downloads'.  Note that an entry
without a numeric ID at the beginning will be applied to all content items.
So it is good practice to put such global overrides first in the list and
then override the item-by-item custom titles afterward.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you wish to change the titles used for attachments lists globally, you
may copy the translations entry 'ATTACH_ATTACHMENTS_TITLE' from the
translation file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
content/attachments/language/qq-QQ/qq-QQ.plg_content_attachments.ini
</pre>
<p>into the global override file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
language/overrides/en-GB.override.ini
</pre>
<p class="last">where qq-QQ refers to the language designator code such as en-GB for
English.  (If you are not familiar with Joomla! translation files, find
the line that has 'ATTACH_ATTACHMENTS_TITLE' on left side of the '=' sign
and the translation on the right in double-quotes.  Edit anything to the
right of the '=' sign.  Do not change anything to the left of the '='
sign.).  The reason to put your translation modifications into the global
override file is because the first translation file listed above is part
of the Attachments extension and will be updated if the Attachments
extensions is upgraded (meaning that any changes you do to it will be
lost).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Timeout for checking links:</strong>
Timeout for checking links (seconds).  Whenever a link is added as an
attachment, the link is checked directly (you can disable this check in the
form).  If the link can be accessed before the timeout, the file size and
other information about the link is retrieved.  If not, generic information
is used.  To disable the check, enter 0.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Superimpose URL link icons:</strong>
Superimpose URL link icons over the file attachment icon for each
attachment to indicate it is a URL.  Valid URLs are shown with arrows and
invalid URLs are shown with a red line across the file type icon (bottom
left to top right).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Suppress obsolete attachments (in back end):</strong>
Set the default for suppressing <em>obsolete</em> attachments in the administrative
back end.  In this context, <em>obsolete</em> attachments are ones attached to
unpublished or trashed parents. You can override this using the 'Show
attachments for' drop-down menu on the right just above the list of
attachments (on the same line as the filter).  When you use the drop-down
menu to control which attachments are visible, the system remembers that
setting until you log out as administrator.  So changing this parameter may
not seem to have an effect.  This parameter setting will come into effect
the next time you log in as administrator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="security-options">
<h2>Security Options</h2>
<img alt="Security Options" class="float-right" src="images/options-security.png" />
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Secure attachment downloads:</strong>
By default, the 'Attachments' extension saves attachment files in a publicly
accessible sub-directory.  If you choose the <em>secure</em> option, the directory
in which the attachments are saved will be made publicly inaccessible.  The
download links for the attachments in the front end will download the
attachment files but will not be direct links.  This will prevent access
unless users have appropriate permissions.  If <em>secure</em> downloads are not
selected, the links to the attachments will be shown as the options above
indicate, but the files will still be accessible to anyone if they know the
full URL, since the sub-directory is public.  The <em>secure</em> option prevents
access to users without appropriate permissions even if they know the full
URL, since this option prevents public access to the attachments
sub-directory.  In <em>secure</em> mode, any attachment set to the 'Public' access
level can be seen and downloaded by anyone.</p>
<div class="hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">If you have problems with filenames with Unicode characters, you should
enable the <strong>Secure attachment downloads</strong> option (especially on Windows
servers).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Download mode for secure downloads:</strong>
This option controls whether files should be downloaded as separate files or
displayed in the browser (if the browser can handle that type of file).
There are two options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><em>'inline'</em> - In this mode, files that can be displayed by the browser</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">will be displayed in the browser (such as text files and images).</p>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">

<h2>Permissions Options</h2>
<p>The permissions options are explained in the following <a class="reference internal" href="#attachments-permissions">Attachments Permissions</a> section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attachments-permissions">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Attachments Permissions</a></h1>
<p>The attachments extension takes full advantage of the new Joomla!
ACL/permissions system introduced in Joomla! 1.6.  This gives websites that
use Attachments much more flexibility to control who can create, edit, delete
and manage attachments.</p>
<p>Before describing the ACL permissions related to Attachments, it is important
to understand a key underlying principle:</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">All attachments are attached to a parent article, category, or other
content item.  Creating, editing, deleting, or changing the state of an
attachment is considered to be a form of editing the parent content
item. So the user must first have permission to edit the parent content item
before any Attachments-specific permissions are checked.</p>
</div>

<h2>Default Permissions</h2>
<p>When the attachments extension is installed, it installs these basic permissions:</p>
<div class="hide-title important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><strong>Basic Behavior Of Default Permissions</strong></p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Authors (and Managers) or above can add attachments to any article/parent they can edit</li>
<li>Authors (and Managers) or above can edit or delete any attachments on any
article/parent they can edit</li>
<li>Editors (and Managers) or above can publish/unpublish attachments from the
front end.</li>
<li>Authors cannot publish their own attachments.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you want different defaults, you will need to edit the permissions using
the &quot;Permissions&quot; tab on the Attachments options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="permissions-settings-for-common-scenarios">
<h2>Permissions Settings for Common Scenarios</h2>
<p>Here are some suggestions about how to set the permissions to achieve the
desired behaviors:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scenario 1 - Authors can publish their own Attachments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In the permissions options, click on the 'Author' entry.  Locate the
'Edit State of Own Attachments' line and set it to 'Allowed' and click on
'Save' to verify the changes.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Permissions setting for scenario1" src="images/permissions-scenario1.png" />
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scenario 2 - Authors can edit/delete their own attachments but no one else's</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In the permissions options, click on the 'Author' entry.  Locate the
'Edit State Of Attachments For Owned Article/Parent' and
'Delete Attachments For Owned Article/Parent' and set them both to 'Denied'.
Click on 'Save' to verify the changes</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Permissions setting for scenario2" src="images/permissions-scenario2.png" />
</div>
<p>Since Author still has permissions to edit/delete their own attachments
this effectively prevents them from editing/deleting attachments that
they did not create, even if they can edit the article.</p>
<p>Note that all user groups derived from Author (e.g., Editor, Publisher,
etc) will also be denied from editing or deleting attachments for
articles/parents that they did not create (from this permission).
Fortunately, they generally have the higher level permissions 'Edit
Attachments' and 'Delete Attachments' which means they can edit or
delete any attachments on any article that they can edit (assuming
their permissions have not been changed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have other common scenarios that you feel should be documented, please
feel free to contact me so I can update this documentation (see the end of
this page for contact information).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-notes-on-permissions">
<h2>Other Notes on Permissions</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a user has permissions to edit the state of their attachments, they
will see the 'Publish: Yes/No' options on forms to add or edit
attachments.  If they select 'No' and save the attachment, the attachment
will still be visible to them in the front end (while they are logged in).
No one else will see the unpublished attachments on the front end.  If the
user wants to change the Published state, they can edit the attachment
(even though it is grayed out) and change the states.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-levels-visibility-control">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Access Levels Visibility Control</a></h1>
<p>The Attachments extension now supports the Joomla 'Access Levels'.  Each
attachment can be assigned to specific access levels such as 'Public',
'Registered', and 'Special', as well as any other access levels created on
your site.   The two basic levels are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>'Public'</strong> - Anyone visiting the website will be able to see and download
attachments with 'access level' set to 'Public' if the article/parent is
visible and no other Attachments visibility settings prevent the
attachments from being shown.</li>
<li><strong>'Registered'</strong> - Anyone that is logged into the website will be able to
see and download attachments with 'access level' set to 'Registered' if the
article/parent is visible and no other Attachments visibility settings
prevent the attachments from being shown.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of other access levels depends on the groups associated with the
access level.</p>
<p>The ability to set the 'Access Level' for individual attachments gives
extensive control on who is able to see and download attachments.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Suppose you create a new access level on your site.  Users that are not
explicitly members of the groups associated with the new access level will
not be able to set their attachments for that access level.  If you edit an
attachment as the Super User, you might be surprised that the new access
level does not show up in the access level options.  There are two
potential issues.  (1) If you have just created the new access level, you
may need to log out of the back end and log in again for the changes to be
completely visible.  (2) The other reason is that the user (Super User, for
instance) is not in the access level.  The fix is simple, make sure the
user is in one of the groups associated with the new access level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-filename-or-url">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Display Filename or URL</a></h1>
<p>Normally, when files are uploaded (or URLs are installed) and listed in a list
of attachments, the full filename (or URL) is shown as a link to download the
attachment.  In some cases, the filename (or URL) may be too long for this to
work nicely.  In the upload form, there is another field called &quot;Display
Filename or URL&quot; in which the person uploading the file can insert an
alternative filename (or URL) or label to display instead of the full filename
(or URL).  For instance, some abbreviation of the filename could be added in
this field.  The field may be edited in the administrative back end when
attachments are edited.  Note: There is an option called &quot;Maximum Filename or
URL Length&quot; in the 'Attachments' extension options.  It can be set to automatically
truncate uploaded displayed filenames; the resulting truncated filename will
be inserted into the &quot;Display Filename or URL&quot; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attaching-urls">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Attaching URLs</a></h1>
<p>Besides files, 'Attachments' version 3.0 has is the ability to &quot;attach&quot; URLs
to content items.  When you bring up one of the &quot;Add attachment&quot; dialog boxes,
you will see a button labeled as &quot;Enter URL instead&quot;.  If you click on it you
will get an entry field for the URL and see two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Verify URL existence?</strong> - In order to determine the file type of the</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">URL (to pick a suitable icon), the code queries the server for basic
information about the file including the file type and size.  In some
cases, the server will not respond to these requests even though the
URL is valid.  By default, Attachment will not accept URLs that have
not been validated by the server.  But if you know the URL is valid,
you can uncheck this option and force the 'Attachments' extension to
take the URL--but there are no guarantees the file type or file size
will be correct.  Note that the server will be queried whether or not
this option is selected.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Relative URL?</strong> - Normally you will enter URLs prefixed with 'http...' to</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">indicate an full website URL.  If you wish to point to files/commands
relative to your Joomla installation, use the 'relative' option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The URLs are shown with the file-type icon and overlaid with an arrow
(indicating that it is a good link) or an red diagonal slash (indicating that
it could not be validated).  When you edit a URL, you can change whether the
link is valid or not to get the overlay you wish.  Also note that URL overlays
can be disabled entirely using the main <strong>Superimpose URL link icons</strong>
parameter.  There are several useful commands relating to URLs (and files) in
the &quot;Utilities&quot; command in the back end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-can-files-be-attached-to">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">What Can Files Be Attached To?</a></h1>
<p>Besides attaching files or URLs to articles, it is possible to
attach files or URLs to other types of content items such as
Categories (see below).  If appropriate 'Attachments' plugins are
installed, it may be possible to attach files or URLs to a wide variety
of content items such as user profiles, shopping cart product
descriptions, etc.  Basically any content item that is displayed on the
front end and uses the content event <tt class="docutils literal">'onPrepareContent'</tt> can host
attachments (if a suitable 'Attachments' plugin is installed).  Content
items that invoke content events are typically items that have content
to be displayed (such as articles) or have descriptions that will be
displayed.</p>
<div class="section" id="attaching-files-or-urls-to-category-descriptions">
<h2>Attaching Files or URLs to Category Descriptions</h2>
<p>With this version of attachments, users can attach files to Category
descriptions.  These descriptions are generally only visible on Category Blog
pages.  Attachments may be added to Category descriptions in the Category
editor.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Attachments for categories will only show the category basic
parameter 'description' is set to <em>Show</em> (via the Menu Editor) AND the
category description is not empty.</p>
</div>
<p>If you wish to learn more about how to develop a new Attachment plugin, there
is a manual that is available as part of this 'Attachments' installation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="plugin_manual/html/index.html">Attachments Plugin Creation Manual</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The Attachment Plugin Creation Manual has not been updated for Attachments
3.0 yet.  There have been some architectural changes that means that
Attachments plugins in Joomla 1.7/2.5+ will have some significant
differences from those for Joomla 1.5.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="css-styling-of-attachment-lists">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">CSS Styling of Attachment Lists</a></h1>
<p>The lists of attachments on the front end are done using a special
'div' that contains a table for the attachments. The table has
several different CSS classes associated with it to allow the website
developer the flexibility to customize the appearance of the table. Look in
the attachments plugin file CSS file (in plugins/content/attachments.css) for
examples. If you wish to change the style, consider copying the original
styles into the end of the same file and renaming 'attachmentsList' in the
copied section to something of your choice.  Edit the 'Attachments' parameter
(in the  component manager) and change the parameter <em>attachments table style</em>
to the new class name. Then modify the class definitions in your copied section
appropriately. This approach will allow you to quickly revert to the original
style by changing the plugin parameter <em>attachments table style</em> back to
its default, 'attachmentsList'. This also has the advantage that the
section of modified styles can be copied to a file and easily brought back in
when the version of 'Attachments' is upgraded. This could also be done via a
CSS &#64;import command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-type-icons">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">File Type Icons</a></h1>
<p>The 'Attachments' extension adds an icon in front of each attachment in the
list of attachments. If you wish to add a new icon type, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Add an appropriate icon in the directory 'media/attachments/icons', if an
appropriate icon is not already there;</li>
<li>Edit the file 'components/com_attachments/file_types.php' and add an
appropriate line to the static array $attachments_icon_from_file_extension
which maps a file extension to an icon name (all in the
media/attachments/icons directory). If this does not work, you may need to
add an appropriate line to the array $attachments_icon_from_mime_type.</li>
<li>Don't forget to make copies of the icon file and the updated file_types.php
to some directory outside of the website directories before upgrading the
version of 'Attachments' in the future.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="administrative-utility-commands">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Administrative Utility Commands</a></h1>
<p>There are several utility commands in the back end that are available for
Administrators.   These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Disable uninstallation of MySQL Attachments Table:</strong> Normally, when the
Attachments extension is uninstalled, the database table is deleted that
contains information about the attachments.   If you wish to retain this
data when uninstalling Attachments, execute this command.  After you
uninstall Attachments the attachments table will remain.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Reinstall Default Asset Rules or Attachments Permissions:</strong> When the
Attachments extension is installed, the installer adds several default asset
rules so that the custom permissions added in the Attachments extension
behave logically and similarly to the standard permissions.  If you
reinstall or update Joomla, these asset rules may be lost.  You can restore
them by executing this command.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Regenerate attachment system filenames:</strong> This command is very useful when
you move (migrate) your attachments from one computer to another.  The full
path each file attachment is kept in the database and called the &quot;system
filename&quot;.  If you move attachments from one system to another, it is very
likely this path information will be incorrect.  You may execute this
command to regenerate all of the system filenames for all file attachments.</p>
<p>The Utility command to &quot;Regenerate system filenames&quot; works for migration
from windows to Linux servers.  It also works for migration from Linux to
Windows servers with a couple of potential problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When you copy your files to your Windows server, you need to verify
that the attachments directory (usually 'attachments') and all files
within it are writable by the Joomla web server.</li>
<li>You may have problems porting files that have Unicode characters in
their filenames because the archiving/unarchiving software has problems
with the Unicode filenames (on the Windows side).  You may need to save
those files, delete the corresponding attachments, and then re-attach
them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Remove spaces from filenames:</strong> You may execute this command to replace
all spaces with underscores in the filename for all file attachments.  This
may be necessary on some systems.  In 'Secure' mode, this should not be
necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Update attachment file sizes:</strong> This command will recompute the file
sizes for all file attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Check existence of attachment files:</strong> This command may be used to verify
that the file exists for all file attachments.  Missing files will be
listed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Validate URLs:</strong> The URL attachments retain information about the validity
of the URL given.  This command will check each URL attachment and check the
validity of the URL and update the validity information for the attachment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In the back end, sometimes when you execute one of the Utility commands, you
may get a warning that the browser needs to resend the request.  This is
harmless, so click [OK] and the command will execute.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="warnings">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Warnings</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>If you have attachment files that are sensitive or private, use the
*Secure attachment downloads* option!</strong> If you do not use the secure option,
the attachment files are saved in a public sub-directory and are accessible
to anyone that knows the full URL.  The <em>secure</em> option prevents access by
anyone that does not have appropriate permissions (as determined by the
options above).  See the discussion of the <em>Secure attachment downloads</em>
option above for more detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Every time a file is uploaded, the existence of the upload sub-directory is
checked and it will be created if if it does not exist.  By default the
sub-directory for uploaded files is 'attachments' in the root directory of
your web site files.  The name of the sub-directory can be changed using the
'Sub-directory for uploads' option. If the 'Attachments' extension is unable
to create the sub-directory for uploads, you must create it yourself (and you
may have problems uploading files).  Make sure to give the sub-directory
suitable permissions for uploading files.  In the Unix/Linux world, that is
probably something like 775.  Note the process of creating the upload
sub-directory may fail if the top level directory of your website has
permissions that prevent the web server (and PHP) from creating
sub-directories.  You may need to loosen the permissions temporarily to allow
the sub-directory to be created by uploading attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If this extension does not permit you to upload specific types of files
(such as zip files), be aware that the extension respects the restrictions
placed by the Media Manager on types of files permitted to be uploaded. This
is to prevent uploading of potentially harmful types of files such as html
or php files. The administrator can update the Media Manager settings to add
specific file types by going to the &quot;Global Settings&quot; item under the &quot;Site&quot;
menu, selecting the &quot;System&quot; tab, and added the appropriate file extension
in lower and upper case and Mime type to the lists under the &quot;Media Manager&quot;
section.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you cannot see the attachments in the front end, there are several
possible reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The attachment is not published.  You can change this in Attachments
manager page in the back end.</li>
<li>The parent article or content item is not published.</li>
<li>The attachment access level is set to 'Registered' and you are
not logged in on the front end.</li>
<li>The 'Content - Attachments' plugin is not enabled.  Use the plugin manager
to enable it.</li>
<li>In the 'Content - Attachments' (via the plugin manager), the access
level is not set to 'Public'.</li>
<li>If your site uses caching, try clearing the caches and refreshing the
page.</li>
<li>If you not seeing attachments for a category in a category blog view
and you are using a custom template, it may be necessary to make a
small modification to the template in order to see the category
attachments.  Feel free to contact the author for help with this
issue (see the contact info at the bottom of this page).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you encounter limits on the sizes of files that you attempt to upload,
try adding the following lines to the .htaccess file in the root of
your Joomla! website:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
php_value upload_max_filesize 32M
php_value post_max_size 32M
</pre>
<p>where you may change the 32M (megabytes) value to whatever you wish as the maximum
upload file size.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'Attachments' now supports &quot;attaching&quot; URLs to content items.  If your server
is Windows Vista and you encounter problems attaching URLs that involve
<tt class="docutils literal">localhost</tt>, this is a known problem related to IPv4 and IPv6 conflicts.
To fix it, edit the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
</pre>
<p>Comment out the line that has <tt class="docutils literal">::1</tt> on it.  Note that <tt class="docutils literal">hosts</tt> is a
hidden system file and you may need to modify your folder options to show
hidden files to see and edit it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you have difficulties attaching files that have Unicode characters (such
as Russian/Cyrillic characters), set the <em>Secure Attachments Downloads</em>
option to 'Yes'.  Filenames with Unicode characters should work properly on
Linux servers in secure or non-secure modes, but do not always work
correctly on Windows servers in non-secure mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'Attachments' now supports attaching files to articles while they are being
created in the Article editor.  There is one limitation to this.  New
attachments are in a state of &quot;limbo&quot; after the file is uploaded and before
the article is actually saved for the first time.  During this (hopefully
brief) limbo period, the new attachments are identified by user id only.  So
if more than one person is using the same user account and they create
articles at the same time and add attachments at the same time, there is no
guarantee that the attached files will end up with the correct article.</p>
